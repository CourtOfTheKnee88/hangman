## What is Hangman
Hangman is a word-guessing game. You are provided with a number of blanks equal to the length of the word. You guess letters to guess the word. Every time you guess a correct letter, every occurrence of the letter will be revealed in the blank spaces. Incorrect letters draw a part of the hangman. You win the game by guessing all letters in the word. You lose the game after a certain number of incorrect guesses depending on difficulty level.

## Difficulty Levels
Our Hangman offers 3 levels of word difficulty and 3 levels of picture difficulty. 

### Word Difficulty

 * Easy difficulty gives words less than or equal to 5 letters in length.
 * Medium difficulty gives words between 6 and 7 letters in length.
 * Hard difficulty gives words greater than 7 letters in length.

### Picture Difficulty
Changing the picture difficulty changes the number of incorrect guesses the player is allowed before losing. 
 * Easy difficulty allows for 9 incorrect guesses.
 * Medium difficulty allows for 6 incorrect guesses.
